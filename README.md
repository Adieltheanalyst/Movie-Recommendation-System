Movie Recommendation System
Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System! This project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to suggest movies based on the user's favorite choices.

How It Works
Data Preparation: Load movie data from a CSV file named "movies.csv" containing features like genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director.

Feature Selection and Combination: Select relevant features such as genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director. Combine them into a single string called "combined_features" to capture essential aspects of each movie.

Feature Vectorization: Use the TF-IDF vectorizer to transform combined features into numerical feature vectors, making them suitable for ML algorithms.

Similarity Calculation: Compute cosine similarity between feature vectors to measure the similarity between different movies.

User Input and Recommendation: When a user enters their favorite movie, find the closest match using fuzzy string matching. Retrieve similarity scores and present a list of recommended movies.
